    Use the right products Choose a shampoo and conditioner that is suitable for your hair type. Avoid products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates, which can strip your hair of its natural oils.

    Wash your hair regularly While everyone's hair is different, most people benefit from washing their hair every 2-3 days. This can help remove excess oil and buildup from the scalp.
    
    Rinse thoroughly Be sure to rinse your hair thoroughly after shampooing and conditioning to avoid buildup and residue.

When a beauty product is extra nice, it feels weird to use it on a random Tuesday. And so there it sits, untouched until the just-right occasion arises when you can give it the attention it seems to deserve. Perhaps it’s because saving your best stuff for special occasions helps add to the feeling of it being truly one of a kind, says therapist Laurel Roberts-Meese, LMFT. It’s why it makes sense to dip into a pricey palette on your birthday or a holiday. Before a Zoom call? Not so much.

<h1>Don't use heat styling machine</h1>

    One way that heat damaged hair occurs is through a loss of moisture. Your hair is made up of different bonds, including 4% fats, oils, and pigments, 17% water, and 79% keratin proteins. The cortex is the inner part of your hair strands, and it contains water molecules that are bound to the keratin proteins.

 

    When heat is applied, the natural oils are stripped from your hair, and the water molecules evaporate, changing the hair’s protein structure. The high temperatures cause the water to dry up quickly, which affects the structure of each strand and can crack the cuticles, the outer layer of hair, making hair more vulnerable to further damage.

    Remove dirt or makeup by wiping from the center outwards, applying gentle pressure. You may need several wipes.
    Repeat the process to make sure you get everything even stuff that isn't necessarily visible
    A cleanser will give your face a deep clean – a deeper clean than makeup wipes can. There are many different types of cleanser available, based on the condition of your skin – normal, oily, or dry. Check the labels to make sure you're using the correct formula

    Getting a deep conditioning treatment at the salon can burn a hole in your pocket and is also pretty time-consuming. An easy alternative to pampering your tresses at home is by whipping up a DIY mask using a few ingredients from your kitchen like a ripe banana, eggs, olive oil and honey. Alternatively, you can also invest in a good mask and use it every alternate weekend. The Tresemme Keratin Smooth Deep Smoothing Mask can repair even the most damaged hair. Infused with the goodness of marula oil, it fights frizz, softens hair and adds a healthy shine. Apply a generous amount, distributing evenly through the hair, from the middle to the ends. Run a wide-tooth comb or your fingers through the hair to smooth and detangle. Leave for 3–5 minutes then wash off.

        <h1>Tackle body odour with a chemical exfoliate</h1>

    Body odor can be an embarrassing and unpleasant problem, but there are ways to tackle it. One effective solution is to use a chemical exfoliant, such as glycolic acid or salicylic acid. These acids can help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores, which can help reduce body odor. In addition, they can also help lighten underarm discoloration caused by deodorants or antiperspirants. However, it's important to use these products carefully and follow the instructions, as overuse can lead to irritation or dryness. With the right approach and products, you can tackle body odor and feel confident and fresh all day long.
